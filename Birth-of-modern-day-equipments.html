		<h1 id= "#Top"> History behind the birth of modern fitness equipment </h1>
		<h2 >Introduction</h2>
		<p>Fitness, whether in the pursuit of physical excellence as well as health improvement, is not 
		a modern innovation.While today&rsquo;s fitness influencers, proclaimed gurus, and industry 
		experts believe in modern fitness equipment, workout programs, and fitness environments 
		started with them – the story is much earlier than today&rsquo;s fitness leaders. As the 
		writer, Marcel Proust, so eloquently stated back in the early 1800s, &quot; What we call our 
		future is the shadow our past casts in front of us.&quot; In essence, the fitness industry 
		of 2019, and what it will become, is simply our fitness shadows coming back to life.
		This article concentrates on 15 innovations of equipment whose shadows 
		still hover around us today. </p>
		
		<h2>Groundbreaking developments in fitness training equipment</h2>
		<p>Fitness equipment, or what we may call fitness training accessories, has a long 
		history that dates back to 800 B.C. Numerous advancements in exercise equipment 
		throughout the past 2,800+ years have altered how athletes, fitness buffs, and 
		ordinary people trained and led active lifestyles. The list of 15 fitness equipment
		breakthroughs that came about and had an impact that is still felt today are provided 
		below.</p>
		
		<h3>Dumbbells</h3>
		<p>The oldest dumbbells were made by Greek trainers and athletes between 800 and 
		700 B.C. to improve athletic performance.The earliest interactions of 
		the dumbbell, known as halters, were composed of stone. Halteres were created in a 
		range of sizes to offer athletes different levels of resistance. In addition to 
		sprinting and general resistance training, Greek athletes utilized halters for 
		lunges, plyometric jumps, and other training exercises. These simple dumbbells developed
		over time, changing from being constructed of wood in the 1700s to having a steel handle 
		connecting two globes filled with iron shot. By the turn of the 20th century, barbells 
		and dumbbells with steel bars that could be loaded with plates had been developed by 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Calvert">Alan Calvert</a>, the inventor 
		of Milo Barbell. Even though modern dumbbells have improved over earlier models, 
		they are still comparable to the ones that were invented approximately 3,000 years ago.</p>

		<h3>Medicine Ball</h3>
		<p>The first medicine ball was invented by Hippocrates, the creator of the <a href= 
		"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath">Hippocratic Oath</a>, around 300 B.C. 
		This was comprised of animal skin wrapped around a sand-filled interior and was used 
		by athletes and fitness enthusiasts for lifting, carrying and throwing. Today’s 
		medicine balls, slam balls, sand bells and sandbags, are all modern imitations of 
		the original medicine ball.</p>

		<h3>Kettlebell</h3>
		<p>Fast forward to the early 1700s, when Russians invented the kettlebell, or &quot;girya&quot;, 
		to show off their skill in local sporting competitions. 
		The kettlebell soon became an essential training accessory for strength athletes seeking 
		to enhance their physical prowess. The majority of kettlebells used today are not far 
		removed from the originals used by Russian strongmen.</p>
		<img src= "ancient-kettlebells.jpeg" width= "200" alt= "Picture of ancient kettlebells">
		
		<h3>Barbell</h3>
		<p>In the 1700s, about the same time the Kettlebell was introduced, fitness practitioners 
		introduced the &quot;wand&quot;. This weighted wooden stick was similar to today&rsquo;s weighted bars, 
		only heavier. The wand soon gave way to the barbell, which was comprised of either 
		wooden sticks or metal bars with weights attached. By the mid-1800s barbells had 
		evolved, comprised of a metal handle with globes on each end, filled with steel shot. 
		These early &quot;barbells&quot; required total body control and engagement of the core. The 
		first plate-loaded barbells, which are the standard today, were introduced around 
		1902 by Milo Barbell company.</p>

		<h3>Indian club</h3>
		<p>The Indian Club, introduced to the British military by native soldiers in India 
		during the early 1800s, became a mainstay of physical training among the British 
		military, and later among many global athletes. In 1834, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Walker">Donald Walker</a>
		- author of British Manly Exercise- introduced Indian Club exercises to the general 
		male population as a mainstream form of fitness training. In 1866, the seminal textbook 
		for Indian Club training was authored by Sim Kehoe. Today, the RMT club and ONNIT steel 
		clubs offered by Roque are modernized conversions of these original training devices.</p>

		<h3> Variable resistance equipment</h3>
		<p>The first iteration of today&rsquo;s variable resistance equipment was introduced in 
		the mid-1800s by <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudley_Allen_Sargent"> Dudley Sargent</a>
		, a Harvard professor. His machines were called variable-resistance pulley machines. 
		By the late 1880s, Dudley Sargent had created 56 different variable-resistance pulley 
		machines with names such as the abdominal pulley system, the chest pulley system, and 
		the back pulley system. By the time he retired from Harvard he had created 56 machines, 
		all housed in Harvard&rsquo;s Hemenway Gymnasium. Many of his pulley systems became 
		mainstays for early fitness facilities around the globe.</p>

		<h3>Progressive Resistance Machine</h3>
		<p>Around the same time, Dudley Sargent was creating his variable resistance machines, 
		Swedish physician Gustav Zander created his progressive resistance machines by employing 
		weights, pulleys, levers, springs, and cams (similar to what the original Nautilus 
		machines had). In total, Gustav Zander created 27 different machines designed to be 
		used for rehabilitative and performance enhancement purposes. The underlying principle 
		behind his machines was what he called progressive exertion, whereby the load placed 
		on the targeted muscles increased throughout the movement. Zander&rsquo;s progressive 
		resistance machines never really caught on with the public, but they re-emerged with 
		the introduction of Nautilus machines in 1970. Arthur Jones’ introduction of the 
		Nautilus represents the second stage in the evolution of variable resistance machines, 
		offering progressive resistance via a modified cam system. One could argue that the 
		early Nautilus machines were merely an innovative twist to Zander’s machines, some 
		of which used cam-like pulley mechanisms. Today, there are many variable resistance 
		models in existence, including Nautilus, with roots that go back to the first 
		machines of Sargent and Zander.</p>

		<h3>The rowing machine</h3>
		<p>Up until the 1800s, most cardiovascular training involved walking, cycling and 
		running. In 1871, William B. Curtis introduced the Curtis rowing machine, which 
		became the first piece of cardiovascular equipment designed solely for indoor training 
		purposes. Curtis was an avid rower. As one of the founding members of the New York 
		Athletic Club, which opened in 1868, he developed the rowing machine so individuals 
		could train year-round no matter where they lived. The Curtis Rowing machine used 
		a flywheel and ratchet system, subsequently becoming a template for future rowing 
		machines, including those currently used in clubs and studios around the world.</p>

		a rowing machine" class="rowing-machine">
		
		<h3>The Manual Treadmill</h3>
		<p>As early as the late 1800s, the thought of engaging in cardiovascular activity 
		indoors or on a piece of equipment was nothing short of crazy, or possibly torture. 
		In the 1870s, Nicholas Potter received three separate patents for treadmills collectively 
		referenced as &quot;enterprise dog power.&quot; The first patent, which came in 1871, applied to 
		the pivoting track frame. In 1875, the second patent was received for the system used 
		to elevate the platform, followed by a third patent for an adjustable and removable 
		track frame. These early treadmills were called &quot; enterprise treadmills &quot; and still 
		exist today. The first of these manual treadmills were used for walking dogs 
		and later evolved into use with humans, similar to today&rsquo;s many manual treadmills such 
		as Technogym&rsquo;s Skillmill and Woodway’s Curve and Curve Trainer.</p>
		<img src= "ancient-treadmill.jpeg" width= "300" alt= "Picture of ancient people using 
		a manual treadmill">
		
		<h3>The Powered Treadmill </h3>
		<p>In 1889, Zuntz and Lehrmann developed the first motorized treadmill. This inaugural 
		motorized treadmill was used in studies of human performance. In 1952, approximately 
		60 years after the introduction of the first motorized treadmill, Quinton introduced 
		a modernized version called the Quinton treadmill, designed by Robert Bruce and Wayne 
		Quinton. The Quinton treadmill was extremely well-built and became a staple of medical 
		centers and universities. The Quinton treadmill also became the benchmark for today&rsquo;s 
		treadmills, though few of these modern versions are likely to have the lifespan associated 
		with the early Quinton treadmills.</p>

		a man riding on a treadmill.">
		
		<h3> The Digital Indoor Bicycles </h3>
		<p>Up until the late 1960s, nearly all indoor bicycles were manually powered, but 
		in 1968, Keene Dimmick introduced something completely new, an electronic bicycle 
		called the Lifecycle. A few years later, Ray Wilson was introduced to the machine 
		and quickly realized that it offered an entirely new element to the equipment 
		currently being employed by fitness clubs. Wilson subsequently purchased the rights 
		to Lifecycle, and soon hired college student Augie Nieto – who would go on to be one 
		of the co-founders of Life Fitness – to bring the Lifecycle to market. Under the 
		entrepreneurial spirit of Wilson and Nieto, the Lifecycle rapidly evolved into one 
		of the two most important innovations to shape the modern-day fitness business.</p>

		indoor bicycle">
		
		<h3>The cross training machine</h3>
		<p>The first powered bicycle designed for indoor use was created in 1932 by Gordon 
		Berg, who was looking for a piece of equipment to counter his wife’s neuromuscular 
		disorder. This resulted in the Exercycle, an exercise device that combined lower- and 
		upper-body movements in a way that simulated rowing, swimming, cycling, and chin-ups. 
		The bike was powered by a small motor that enabled users to go through a range of 
		motion, with varying levels of resistance. The Exercycle was the first piece of exercise 
		equipment that focused on providing cross-functional conditioning, for both the 
		neuromuscular and cardiovascular systems. Many of today&quot;s modern cross-trainers are 
		nothing more than modernized updates of this pioneering original.</p>
		
		<h3>The Stability Ball</h3>
		<p>Now a staple fitness accessory used by trainers around the globe, the stability 
		ball, was initially introduced by an Italian plastic manufacturer, Aquilino Cosani 
		in 1963 and called the Pezzi ball. The Pezzi ball initially gained fame and fortune 
		thanks to the efforts of British physiotherapist Mary Quinton, who used it with infants. 
		The stability ball gained further prominence when Dr. Suzanne Klein-Vogelbach, director 
		of the Physical Therapy School in Basel Switzerland, incorporated the ball into her 
		physical therapy protocols for neuro-development. Her exercises were entitled 
		&quot; functional kinetics.&quot; Subsequently, American physical therapists called the device 
		a Swiss Ball, which of course has now evolved into the stability ball.</p>

		<h3>The Stair Climber</h3>
		<p>The very first stair-climbing machine, then referred to as a treadmill, was created 
		by an English engineer William Cubitt in 1817. These early stair-climbing devices were 
		introduced to torture prisoners by engaging them in intense exercise while concurrently 
		starving them. These early stair-climbing machines were called treadmills, but when 
		you see images of them it quickly brings to mind the first Stairmaster, which used 
		a revolving stair. Beyond these rudimentary torture machines, the first official 
		stair-climbing machine was introduced in 1984 with the launch of The StairMaster 
		5000 designed by Lanny Potts, one of the three co-founders of StairMaster Exercise 
		Systems. The first Stairmaster 5000 featured rotating stairs. Two years later, in 
		1986, Randall Sports&sol; Medical, formerly StairMaster, introduced the StairMaster 4000 
		PT mechanical stair stepper. The 4000 PT went on to become the single most popular 
		piece of cardiovascular equipment in the 1980s and early 1990s. Over the past five years, 
		stair-climbing machines have made a comeback of sorts, with new versions being made 
		by multiple industry vendors.</p>

		<h3> The Elliptical Machine</h3>
		<p>The most recent non-digital innovation on our list is the elliptical trainer – 
		introduced in 1995 by Precor. The EFX 544, as it became more commonly known in the 
		industry, brought forward an entirely new mode of cardio training. The EFX was designed 
		to provide individuals with a form of cardio training designed to lessen the impact 
		forces associated with using a treadmill. The EFX gained incredible popularity upon 
		its introduction, primarily due to users perceiving it as less intense and less 
		discomforting than other forms of cardio training.</p>
