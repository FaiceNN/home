		<h2>  id = "Top"> What is Kung Fu? </h2> 
		<img src="kung-fu-pic.jpeg" width="500" alt="Kung fu picture">
		<p>The term &lsquo;Kung Fu&rsquo; refers to the martial arts of China. Kung Fu 
		originated in a place called the Shaolin Temple, where monks practiced Kung Fu for
		health and self-defense during their quest for enlightenment.</p>
		
		<p>The first Shaolin temple was a Buddhist monastery built in 377 A.D. in the Henan
		province of China. In 527 A.D. a Buddhist prince, Bodhidharma, or Da Mo in Chinese, 
		traveled to the temple for religious teaching, but found the monks weak and poor in 
		health. To find a way to give the monks strength and vitality, Da Mo locked himself
		in a room for nine years of meditation. His resulting work, Yi Jin Jing, a series 
		of exercises that developed strength, vitality, and internal energy, is considered 
		the original Shaolin martial art.</p>
		
		<p> Historically, Kung Fu in China was an integral part of the education of scholars
		and the leaders of government. The Chinese people placed great value on the practice
		of Kung Fu because they felt it taught respect, patience, humility, and morality.</p>
		
		<p>Many Americans believe that Kung Fu is a term that describes a single martial 
		art, much like Taekwondo, Judo or Aikido. In reality, Kung Fu is a general term 
		which includes hundreds of styles of Chinese martial arts. Some examples of Kung Fu 
		styles are Long Fist, Eagle Claw, and Taiji Quan.</p>
		
		<p>Another misconception is that Kung Fu is a &quot;soft&quot; style compared with 
		Karate or other &quot;hard&quot; styles. This is not so: each Kung Fu style contains
		both hard and soft techniques. Also, many people believe that Kung Fu is an external
		style and Taiji Quan is an internal development, all styles of Kung Fu contain both 
		internal and external components.</p>
		
		<h2>History of the Eagle Claw Style </h2>
		<p>The Eagle Claw Style of Kung Fu, Ying Jow Pai in Chinese, is one of the oldest, 
		most complete and complex systems of surviving Shaolin styles, and is known for its 
		powerful joint-locking throws, and pressure point Strikes. Eagle Claw started in 
		1130, at a time of Mongolian incursions into northern China, where General Yue Fei 
		learned fighting techniques from Shaolin Monk. Yue Fei adapted the techniques for 
		his army, which went on to many battlefield victories. The resulting fighting system 
		was passed down through the ages from selected Shaolin monks to their disciples at 
		the Shaolin Temple.</p>
		
		<p>In the 1800s, the Eagle Claw system was learned by the Lau family. In the 1920s,
		two of the most famous members of the Lau family, Lau Fat Man and Chen Zi Zheng, 
		became associated with the Jing Wu Gymnasium, and taught Eagle Claw Kung Fu to 
		hundreds of students all over China. Chen Zi Zheng became notorious in Southern 
		China for his ability to defeat any opponent in only three moves. </p>
		 
		<p>Chen Zi Zheng's top student was Ng Wai Nung, who taught the Eagle Claw System 
		at the Hong Kong Eagle Claw Association until the 1980s. Ng Wai Nung's top student 
		was Shum Leung, who also taught at the Hong Kong Eagle Claw Association from the 
		1950s until 1972, when he came to the United States. </p>
		 
		<p>All of General Yue Fei's techniques survive today and have come to America 
		through the teachings of Grand Master Shum Leung, who is one of the few instructors 
		in the world qualified to teach the entire Eagle Claw system.</p>
		 
		<h2>How Kung Fu is Taught </h2>
		<p>In your first class, you will be faced with a great deal of new information. 
		In addition to exercises for stretching, muscle power, and vital energy, there are 
		the actual movements of Long Fist. Each movement contains many physical components: 
		movements of the feet, legs, trunk, arms, hands, eyes, and breath. There is also 
		an underlying mental component of each movement. Every movement has a specific 
		purpose, and it is up to the teacher to develop each student's understanding of
		that purpose, so the student can extract maximum benefit from the practice.</p>
		
		<p>Some who teach martial arts are not aware of the underlying purpose of each 
		movement, and simply expect students to follow them through a series of unfamiliar 
		and meaningless movements. Other teachers expect that students to fight or work with 
		advanced students in the first lesson. Learning Kung Fu at our school is different.
		</p>
		
		<p>In your first class, you will begin learning how to condition your body. After 
		your first month, you will feel a difference in the strength of your arms and legs, 
		an increased ability to concentrate, and an improvement in your overall health.</p>
		
		<p>After your first six months, your increased strength and concentration will 
		enable you to perform a set of basic Kung Fu movements, and you will feel the energy 
		such as you have never known. Progress without unnecessary frustration or injury 
		is possible because, as teachers of Chinese martial arts, we understand the 
		underlying nature of the movements, their true purpose, and how to teach them 
		systematically to beginner students.</p>
		
		<h2>Differences between Kung Fu and other Martial Arts</h2>
		
		<h3>Kung Fu puts Philosophy into Practice</h3>
		<p>The philosophy of Chinese martial arts originated not with warlords whose aim 
		was to kill, but with Buddhist masters whose aim was to prolong life. This philosophy 
		and history has led to a difference in the practice and the attitude of students 
		of Chinese martial arts.</p>
		
		<p>Unbelievable violence and hostility are found in some martial arts systems. Such 
		behavior is not found in Kung Fu training, because the nature of the training is 
		such that a calm disposition and a feeling for one's training partners are developed 
		intrinsically, and harboring selfish, aggressive attitudes would work against the 
		practitioners themselves.</p>
		
		<h3>Kung Fu is a comprehensive system</h3>
		<p>Martial arts techniques are divided into four areas: striking, kicking, grappling,  
		throwing, seizing, and locking the joints. Every type of Chinese Kung Fu 
		contains techniques from each of these four areas. This is important because each 
		category of techniques is effective against one or more of the other categories. A 
		Chinese martial artist, therefore, can deal with every type of attack and defend 
		himself effectively.</p>
		
		<p>Other martial arts, like Karate, Judo, Jujitsu, and Taekwondo, specialize in only 
		one or two of the four categories of techniques. Because of the nature of these 
		martial arts, their practitioners often have difficulty if opponents use attacks 
		that fall outside the categories in which their respective arts specialize.</p>
		
		<p>One way to prepare yourself to handle any fighting situation is to learn all 
		these different martial arts. A better alternative is to learn a Chinese martial 
		art like Long Fist. It not only saves time and effort, but it also gives advantages 
		not found in other martial arts.</p>
		
		<h2> The Benefits of Chinese Martial Arts </h2>
		
		<h3> Health and Fitness </h3>
		<p>By health, we mean not only being free from illness but the ability to sleep 
		soundly, to work energetically, to think clearly, and to be calm yet alert. By 
		fitness, we mean not just physical strength, but the ability to react quickly, to 
		endure hard work, and concentrate without mental fatigue.</p>
		
		<p>Kung Fu is better than other forms of exercise for promoting health and fitness. 
		In swimming, jogging, and karate, for example, the fitness acquired diminishes as 
		one grows old, but in Kung Fu, it is enhanced. This is because Kung Fu is more than 
		physical exercise; it develops the inner faculties of vital energy and the mind. 
		A Kung Fu practitioner will exhibit more zest and vitality in both works and play 
		than an ordinary person, and have calmness of mind and clarity of thought even 
		under demanding situations.</p>
		
		<h3> Character Training </h3>
		<p>Kung Fu teaching emphasizes moral development as well as physical training, 
		stressing values like respect, courage, tolerance, and reverence for life. The very 
		nature of Kung Fu training is a long process of character building. Wholesome 
		qualities like endurance, perseverance, discipline, loyalty, and a calm disposition 
		are prerequisites for progress, especially at higher levels. All these qualities, 
		acquired through Kung Fu training, are transferable to daily life.</p>
		
		<h3> Self-Defense </h3>
		<img src="self-defence.jpeg" width= "350" alt="Picture of two people practicing kung-fu">
		<p>Self-defense is the essence of Chinese martial arts. True Kung Fu teaching always 
		instructs students to be tolerant and avoid fighting, but the ability to defend 
		oneself is a valuable asset. It is only when we know that we can defend ourselves 
		effectively that we gain self-confidence. In this way, self-defense can be applied 
		to non-combative situations, such as job interviews or school exams. In modern 
		society, this need for psychological self-defense is perhaps more important than 
		the need to fight.</p>
